## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
print(plot)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r cars}
a = 3
y = 4
x <- y + 2
b <- a + 2


print(x+b)
```
```{r cars}

all_C_temps <- seq(-40, 40, 1)
all_F_temps <- all_C_temps * 9/5 + 32


plot(x=all_C_temps, y=all_F_temps, xlab="xlab", ylab="ylab", main="title")

```
